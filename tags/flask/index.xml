      <description> In this project, I developed a simple web application for interactive visualization of stock price using Bokeh and Flask modules in Python. Users can select any company to compare the trends of Close Price, Adjusted Close Price, Open Price and Adjusted Open Price for that selected company.

      <description>In The Data Incubator, my capstone project was NLP in automated essay scoring, which was completed in Nov,2018, at that time, I havenâ€™t learned the techniques of NLP with deep learning, so this project only involves basic NLP methods such as BOW, n-gram and tree-based boosting model.
