      <description>In binary classification, a response function (or a link function) is used to turn the output of a regression model into class probability, so the domain of the output from a regression model is squashed into [0, 1] range. Common link function is logistic function (another one is probit function, which will not be discussed here). For a data point \((x_i, c_i)\),
\[ p(c_i|x_i, w) = \frac{1}{1+exp(-x_i&amp;#39;w)} = \sigma(x_i&amp;#39;w) \]</description>

      <title>Correspondence Between Infinitely Wide Deep Neural Networks and Gaussian Process</title>

      <description>Equivalency between Gaussian Process and DNNs Previous studies have shown the equivalency between Gaussian Process (GP) [1] and infinitely wide fully-connected Neural Networks (NNs) [2][4], which implies that if we choose a fully-connected NN with infinite width, the function computed by the NN is equivalent to a function drawn from a GP under appropriate statistical assumptions. The analytic forms of GP kernel for DNNs were also subsequentially developed.
The following figure shows the consistency between the theoretical GP (contour rings) and the sampled \(z_i\) at the initial layer (left) and the third layer (right) in a DNN.</description>
