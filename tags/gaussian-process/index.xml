      <description>High stakes applications of NLP models such as educational assessments require a trade-off between the complex pattern recognition functionalities of deep learning models and the interpretability of knowledge-driven handcrafted features. In this paper, we propose a hybrid two-stage closed-form model called the Gaussian Process Deep and Wide Neu ral Networks (GPDWNNs) that combines strengths of knowledge-driven (wide) features with deep features from encoders such as BERT. Moreover, due to the closed-form solutions of GPDWNNs, we are able to significantly reduce computation time required for model parameter estimation versus training a deep network for comparable tasks.</description>
