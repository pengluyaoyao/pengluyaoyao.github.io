My name is Luyao Peng. I am a Ph.D. candidate in applied statistics with specialization in the mixed-effects model and computational linguistics. I apply natural language processing and build machine learning algorithms to automatize essay scoring and detect cheating behavior. 

My current <a href="https://pengluyaoyao.github.io/Resume_Luyao_Peng_DS.pdf" target="_blank">C.V.</a>

My Research Projects:

* Using linear mixed-effects model to detect fraudulent erasures at an aggregate level (<a href="https://pengluyaoyao.github.io/post/using-linear-mixed-effects-model-to-detect-fraudulent-erasures-at-an-aggregate-level">abstract</a>)
* An algorithmic construction of all unbiased estimators of variance components in linear mixed effects models (<a href="https://pengluyaoyao.github.io/post/dissertation">abstract</a>)

My Data Science Projects:

* [Stock price visualization](https://luyao-tdi-milestone.herokuapp.com/)
* [NLP essay grader](https://easygrader.herokuapp.com/)
* [Cheating behavior detection in essay scoring and forensic analysis] (https://kpca-outlier-detection.shinyapps.io/Shiny/)
* [Dependency Parsing w/ Tensorflow] (https://pengluyaoyao.github.io/post/assignment2/)

My R Packages:

* [MMeM] (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/MMeM/index.html)
* [regrrr] (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/regrrr/index.html)
