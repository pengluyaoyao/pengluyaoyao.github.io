      <description>In The Data Incubator, my capstone project was NLP in automated essay scoring, which was completed in Nov,2018, at that time, I havenâ€™t learned the techniques of NLP with deep learning, so this project only involves basic NLP methods such as BOW, n-gram and tree-based boosting model.

      <title>Dependency Parsing Using Deep Learning NN Model</title>

      <description>This project extends Neural Transition-based dependeny Parsing (Stanford U cs224n A#2 Q2). The goal is to build a three layer neural network using TensorFlow to parse the dependency structure of sentences. The orignal code contributed by hankcs is built in Python2. I revised it so it runs in Python3. The training data for the neural dependency parser model is Penn Treebank, and each sentence has &amp;lsquo;word&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;POS&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;head&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;label&amp;rsquo;,</description>
