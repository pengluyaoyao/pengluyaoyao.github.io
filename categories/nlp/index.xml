      <description>In The Data Incubator, my capstone project was NLP in automated essay scoring, which was completed in Nov,2018, at that time, I havenâ€™t learned the techniques of NLP with deep learning, so this project only involves basic NLP methods such as BOW, n-gram and tree-based boosting model.
