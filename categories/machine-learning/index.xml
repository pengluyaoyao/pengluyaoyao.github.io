      <description>In binary classification, a response function (or a link function) is used to turn the output of a regression model into class probability, so the domain of the output from a regression model is squashed into [0, 1] range. Common link function is logistic function (another one is probit function, which will not be discussed here). For a data point \((x_i, c_i)\),
\[ p(c_i|x_i, w) = \frac{1}{1+exp(-x_i&amp;#39;w)} = \sigma(x_i&amp;#39;w) \]</description>

      <description>One-class classification problem is useful in many applications. For example, if people want to diagnoze the healthy condition of machines, measurements on the normal operation of the machine are easy to obtain, and most faults will not haveoccurred so one will have little or no training data for the negative class. Another example is web security detection, people only have data for normal web behavior , since once abnormal behavior occurs, the web security will be attacked, which is a situation people try to prevent from happening.</description>
