      <description>RNN The language model computes the probability of a sequence of previous words, \(P(word_1, word_2, \dots, word_t)\). The traditional language model is based on naive bayes model, the probability of a sequence of words is:
\[ P(word_1, word_2, \dots, word_{t}) = \prod_{i = 1}^{t} P(word_i|word_1, \dots, word_{i-1}). \]
The cons of traditional language models assumes independence among words (this is the naive part), which is not true in reality, it also requires a lot of RAM to compute the conditional probabilities for each word.</description>
